<h1>Sayollo SDK</h1>
Sayollo SDK contains API for creating IDisposable instances of both video and purchase ads therefore such ads can be disposed (cancelled) when needed. 
Also ads have info about result of their performance (Success/Error/Cancelled).
I used async-await to implement web interactions because it fits well for these kind of tasks.
